In this lab, you will explore the client-server architecture by running a server on your machine that listens for requests to be sent to it. Once running, this server will be able to listen for a request to be sent to it and will be able to process this request if it recognises the request. Your objective is to modify the Request class such that the server is able to recognise the requests that are sent to the server in the test class.
